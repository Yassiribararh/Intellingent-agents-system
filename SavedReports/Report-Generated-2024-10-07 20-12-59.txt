The proposed approach uses a modular design which defines each agent’s role and how it communicates to the next agent Related: Multi-agent-based applications using JavaScript¶ As the Multi-agent-specific architecture introduces the functionality of multiple agents, in addition to managing the associated information between the agents it implements different functions in a very simple, high-functioning, interoperable JavaScript environment. An example of this is illustrated with the example below that shows how one agent's task management (DIM) system can support a variety of tasks to perform with one another and many more tasks are available for a single agent. A simple program can then perform a given task directly between different Agent's and perform the desired tasks via the assigned agent. For example, if this task happens to include some additional required information, this Agent will be able to provide the information to the next agent as a full-
